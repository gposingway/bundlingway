# Privacy Policy

This privacy policy describes the data practices of the Bundlingway project (the "Project"), which is available on [https://github.com/gposingway/bundlingway](https://github.com/gposingway/bundlingway).

**Bundlingway collects no personal data and shares no personal data.**

## 1. Information Collection

Bundlingway itself does not collect any personal data from users.

As this Project is hosted on GitHub, GitHub may collect certain information related to user interactions with the project, such as:

*   **GitHub Account Information:** If a user interacts with the Project on GitHub (e.g., starring, forking, contributing, opening issues, or commenting), GitHub will record their GitHub username and related public profile information. This data collection is governed by [GitHub's Privacy Policy](https://docs.github.com/en/github/site-policy/github-privacy-statement). Bundlingway project maintainers do not directly access or use this GitHub-specific data beyond what is publicly available on the GitHub platform.
*   **Aggregated and Anonymized Data:**  Access may be granted to aggregated and anonymized data provided by GitHub, such as overall project usage statistics (e.g., number of clones, stars, etc.). This data is used to understand the general interest in and usage of the Project and does not include any personally identifiable information.

## 2. Use of Information

As Bundlingway does not collect any personal data, personal data is not used for any purposes.  Any aggregated, anonymized data is used solely to understand and improve the Project in general.

## 3. Sharing of Information

Bundlingway does not share any personal data with third parties because personal data is not collected.

Please be aware that user interactions on the GitHub platform are subject to [GitHub's Privacy Policy](https://docs.github.com/en/github/site-policy/github-privacy-statement), and any information chosen to be shared publicly on GitHub will be visible to others.

## 4. Data Security

Bundlingway itself does not store or process any personal data.  Security of the GitHub platform is managed by GitHub. Please refer to [GitHub's Security Practices](https://docs.github.com/en/github/site-policy/github-security).

## 5. User Rights

As Bundlingway does not collect personal data, there are no specific data rights to exercise directly with Bundlingway. For any data related to a user's GitHub account, please refer to user rights and options as outlined in [GitHub's Privacy Policy](https://docs.github.com/en/github/site-policy/github-privacy-statement) and account settings on GitHub.

## 6. Third-Party Links

The Project may contain links to third-party websites or services. Responsibility is not assumed for the privacy practices of these third parties. Users are encouraged to review the privacy policies of any third-party websites or services visited.

## 7. Changes to This Privacy Policy

This privacy policy may be updated from time to time. Notification of any changes will be provided by posting the new privacy policy on the Project's GitHub repository. Users are advised to review this privacy policy periodically for any changes.
